grconv
------

*Grconv* converts between a large number of character sets,
transcription, and transliteration methods that are used to represent
Greek text. In addition, it supports a number of encodings used to
represent those character sets in different environments. *Grconv* reads
the file(s) specified in its command line printing the converted results
on its standard output, or runs as a filter, reading text from its
standard input printing the converted result on its standard output; the
redirection operator \> can be used to write to files. *Grconv* can be
used in three different ways:

1.  To convert between one character set and its representation method
    into another.

2.  To transcribe or transliterate Greek text represented using a
    specified method into plain Latin characters.

3.  To convert Latin text produced by the above transliteration
    operation back into a specified representation of Greek text.

The following character sets can be specified for the source and the
target text:\
MS737, cp737, 737, 437GR, IBM423, cp423, ebcdic-cp-gr, Latin-greek-1,
iso-ir-27, greek7-old, iso-ir-18, greek-ccitt, iso-ir-150, latin-greek,
iso-ir-19, greek7, iso-ir-88, IBM851, cp851, 851, MAC\_GR,
ISO\_5428:1980, iso-ir-55, MS1253, cp1253, Windows, Windows-1253,
ISO10646, ISO\_10646, ISO-10646, Unicode, IBM869, cp869, 869, cp-gr,
ISO\_8859-7:1987, 928, ELOT928, iso-ir-126, ISO\_8859-7, ISO-8859-7,
ELOT\_928, ECMA-118, greek, and greek8.

Unicode data can be read or written using the following encodings:\
UCS-2, UCS-16, UCS-16BE, UCS-16LE, UTF-8, UTF-7, Java, and HTML.

All 8-bit character sets can be read or written using the following
encodings:\
8bit, Base64, Quoted, RTF, HTML, HTML-Symbol, HTML-Lat, and Beta.

## Building
To compile grconv edit the Makefile setting the following variables:  
`CC`      - The name of your C++ compiler  
`BINDIR`  - The installation directory for the program executable  
`MANDIR`  - The installation directory for the program manual page

You will need a C++ compiler and the appropriate libraries, Perl,
and the flex(1) lexical analyzer.  The 4 C++ files generated by flex(1) and
the 2 C++ files generated by the Perl script are included in the source
distribution in case flex and/or Perl are not available.  To regenerate
the Windows `makefile.msc` after changing Makefile you will also need sed(1).

Run `make` to compile the program and `make install` to install the
program and its documentation.  Under Windows run `nmake /f makefile.msc`
to compile the program.
