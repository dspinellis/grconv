grconv
------

*Grconv* converts between a large number of character sets,
transcription, and transliteration methods that are used to represent
Greek text. In addition, it supports a number of encodings used to
represent those character sets in different environments. *Grconv* reads
the file(s) specified in its command line printing the converted results
on its standard output, or runs as a filter, reading text from its
standard input printing the converted result on its standard output; the
redirection operator \> can be used to write to files. *Grconv* can be
used in three different ways:

1.
:   To convert between one character set and its representation method
    into another.

2.
:   To transcribe or transliterate Greek text represented using a
    specified method into plain Latin characters.

3.
:   To convert Latin text produced by the above transliteration
    operation back into a specified representation of Greek text.
